# Crafting Interpreters: JLox Interpreter

Work through the Java-based tree-walk 
Lox language interpreter from *Crafting Interpreters* 
by Robert Nystrom (https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
These notes mainly reference the online edition.


# Notes

## Chapter 6

No issues

## Chapter 5

* Some code is example only. Notes indicate whether each
snippet should be added to your implementation.

## Chapter 4

* Note that many symbols (methods, attributes) will 
be defined after they are first presented in the text. 
Don't expect the project to build cleanly immediately.
